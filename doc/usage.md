# capa usage

See `capa -h` for all supported arguments and usage examples.

## tips and tricks

  - [match only rules by given author or namespace](#only-run-selected-rules)
  - [IDA Pro capa explorer](#capa-explorer)
  - [IDA Pro rule generator](#rule-generator)

### only run selected rules
Use the `-t` option to run rules with the given metadata value (see the rule fields `rule.meta.*`).
For example, `capa -t william.ballenthin@mandiant.com` runs rules that reference Willi's email address (probably as the author), or
`capa -t communication` runs rules with the namespace `communication`.

### IDA Pro integrations
You can run capa from within IDA Pro. Run `capa/main.py` via `File - Script file...` (or ALT + F7). 
When running in IDA, capa uses IDA's disassembly and file analysis as its backend. 
These results may vary from the standalone version that uses vivisect.
IDA's analysis is generally a bit faster and more thorough than vivisect's, so you might prefer this mode.

When run under IDA, capa supports both Python 2 and Python 3 interpreters.
If you encounter issues with your specific setup, please open a new [Issue](https://github.com/fireeye/capa/issues).

Additionally, capa comes with an IDA Pro plugin located in the `capa/ida` directory: the explorer.

#### capa explorer
The capa explorer allows you to interactively display and browse capabilities capa identified in a binary.
As you select rules or logic, capa will highlight the addresses that support its analysis conclusions.
We like to use capa to help find the most interesting parts of a program, such as where the C2 mechanism might be.

To install the plugin, you'll need to be running IDA Pro 7.4 or 7.5 with either Python 2 or Python 3.
Next make sure pip commands are run using the Python install that is configured for your IDA install:

  1. Only if running Python 2.7, run command `$ pip install https://github.com/williballenthin/vivisect/zipball/master`
  2. Run `$ pip install .` from capa root directory
  3. Open IDA and navigate to `File > Script fileâ€¦` or `Alt+F7`
  4. Navigate to `<capa_install_dir>\capa\ida\` and choose `ida_capa_explorer.py`
