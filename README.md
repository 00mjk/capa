# capa

capa detects capabilities in executable files.
You run it against a .exe or .dll and it tells you what it thinks the program can do.
For example, it might suggest that the file is a backdoor, is capable of installing services, or relies on HTTP to communicate.

```
$ capa.exe suspicious.exe

# download

Download stable releases of the standalone capa binaries [here](/releases). You can run the standalone binaries without installation. See [doc/installation.md](doc/installation.md) for details on using capa as a library in another project.

Alternatively, you can fetch a nightly build of a standalone binary from one of the following links. These are built using the latest development branch.
- Windows 64bit: TODO
- Linux: TODO
- OSX: TODO


# installation

See [doc/installation.md](doc/installation.md) for information on how to setup the project, including how to use it as a Python library.

For more information about how to use capa, including running it as an IDA script/plugin see [doc/usage.md](doc/usage.md).

# example

In the above sample output, we ran capa against an unknown binary (`suspicious.exe`),
and the tool reported that the program can decode data via XOR,
contains an embedded PE, writes to a file, and spawns a new process.
Taken together, this makes us think that `suspicious.exe` could be a dropper or backdoor.
Therefore, our next analysis step might be to run `suspicious.exe` in a sandbox and try to recover the payload.

By passing the `-vv` flag (for Very Verbose), capa reports exactly where it found evidence of these capabilities.
This is useful for at least two reasons:

  - it helps explain why we should trust the results, and enables us to verify the conclusions, and
  - it shows where within the binary an experienced analyst might study with IDA Pro
